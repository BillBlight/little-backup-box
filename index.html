		<h1>Little Backup Box</h1>
		<hr style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
		<p>
			Little Backup Box is an application that transforms a Raspberry Pi (or any single-board computer running a
			Debian-based Linux distribution) into an inexpensive, fully-automatic, pocketable backup device. While the
			primary purpose of Little Backup Box is to serve as a photo backup device, it's not limited to this specific
			usage scenario.

		<h2>Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Back up the contents of a storage card to an external USB storage device. Little Backup Box supports
				practically any USB card reader, and, by extension, any card format.</li>
			<li>Transfer photos and RAW files directly from a camera to an external USB storage device. If your camera
				is supported by gPhoto2 software, it will work with Little Backup Box.</li>
			<li>Use multiple cards. Little Backup Box assigns a unique ID to each card and create a separate folder for
				each card on the backup storage device.</li>
			<li>Perform card backup fully automatically with no user interaction.</li>
			<li>Start specific backup operations manually using Little Backup Box's web UI.</li>
			<li>Automatically generate a minimalist responsive gallery from the backed up RAW files.</li>
			<li>Stream the backed up photos to any DLNA-compatible client.</li>
			<li>Access the backed up content from other machines on the network.</li>
			<li>Push backed up contents to a cloud storage service.</li>
		</ul>
